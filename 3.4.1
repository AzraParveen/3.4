** Importance of Name node in Hadoop Cluster :

> Name node is the centerpiece of an HDFS system,it keeps the directory tree of all files in the system.
> NameNode stores the metadata of HDFS 
> NameNode keeps the track where the file data is kept across the cluster.
> Whenever a file is placed in the cluster a corresponding entry of its location is maintained by the NameNode.
> The NameNode is a multithreaded system and processes requests simultaneously from multiple clients.

** Name Node consists of two important files on its hard disk :
> fsimage(file system image): it contains
- A directory structure of the HDFS
- Replication level of the files
- Modification and access times of files
- Access permissions of files and directories
- Block size of files
- Blocks constituting a file

> Edits
- When any operation takes place in HDFS, the directory structure gets modified
- These modifications are stored in the memory as well as in the edits files (edits files are stored on the hard disk)
- If the existing fsimage file gets merged with edits, we'll get an updated fsimage file
- This process is called "checkpointing" and is carried out by the Secondary NameNode. It takes the fsimage and edits
  files from the NameNode and returns updated fsimage file after merging.
